## Key Features

Based on our powerful web dashboard, TicketForge offers:

- **Intuitive Ticket Creation:** Enable users to open tickets via Buttons, Select Menus (Dropdowns), or Multi-Panel layouts.

- **Smart Automation:** Automatically close inactive tickets, send transcripts to DMs, or assign roles upon ticket creation.

- **Statistics & History:** View detailed insights into ticket volume, staff performance, and response times.
- **Tickets as Threads:** Keep your channel list clean by utilizing Discord Threads for support tickets.
