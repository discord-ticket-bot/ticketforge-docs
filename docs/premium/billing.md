# Managing Billing

You can manage your subscription directly from the TicketForge Dashboard.

## Viewing Status

Navigate to the **Premium** tab. The top card shows your current status:

- **Active:** Subscription is valid and running.
- **Past Due:** Payment failed. We will retry automatically.
- **Canceled:** Subscription will end at the specified date.
- **Trialing:** You are currently on a free trial period.

## Managing Payment Methods

Click the **Manage Billing** button in the Premium dashboard to open the Stripe Customer Portal. From there, you can:

- Update credit card details.
- Download past invoices.
- Change billing email.
- Cancel your subscription.

!!! note "Permissions"
Only the **Server Owner** (the user who owns the Discord server) can access the Billing Portal for security reasons.

## Transferring Premium

Subscriptions are tied to the **Discord Server ID**. They cannot be transferred between servers automatically.

If you need to move a subscription to a new server:

1.  Cancel the subscription on the old server.
2.  Subscribe on the new server.
3.  Contact our support team if you have unused time remaining; we may be able to assist with credits.
