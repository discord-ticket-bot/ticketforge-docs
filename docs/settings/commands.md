# Command Management

TicketForge offers granular control over Slash Commands. You can disable specific commands entirely or restrict them to specific channels and roles.

## Configuration

Navigate to the **Commands** tab in the sidebar. You will see a list of all available bot commands.

### Command Settings

Click on any command to edit its permissions:

1.  **Enable Command:** Master toggle. If OFF, the command acts as if it doesn't exist.
2.  **Support Team Only:** Restricts usage to users who have a role designated as "Support" in any of your panels.
    - _Admin Commands (e.g., `/setup`, `/purge-tickets`) are restricted to Administrators automatically._

### Scope Restrictions

You can fine-tune where commands work:

- **Allowed Channels:** The command will _only_ work in these channels.
- **Blocked Channels:** The command will work everywhere _except_ these channels.
- **Allowed Roles:** Only these roles can use the command.
- **Blocked Roles:** These roles are specifically prevented from using the command.
